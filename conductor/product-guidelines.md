# Product Guidelines

## 1. Visual Style
*   **Aesthetic:** Whimsical and playful, focused on a soft and romantic atmosphere.
*   **Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** Classic Valentine's colors - shades of pink, red, and cream.
    *   **Secondary:** Pastel colors for the hearts to provide variety while staying within the theme.
*   **Background:** A stylized starfield environment featuring simple, glowing particles to create a sense of floating in space and magical depth.
*   **Typography:** Whimsical and rounded fonts to maintain a lighthearted and friendly feel for the personalized message and UI elements.

## 2. Tone of Voice
*   **Personality:** Warm, affectionate, and fun.
*   **Language:** Lighthearted and playful, avoiding overly formal or heavy sentimentalism.

## 3. UI/UX Principles
*   **Minimalist UI:** The 3D scene should be the main focus. Any UI elements (like the message or reset buttons) should be non-intrusive.
*   **Smooth Motion:** Physics and camera movements should feel fluid and gentle, not jarring.
*   **Direct Feedback:** Interaction with hearts (clicking/dragging) should provide immediate and satisfying visual feedback.
